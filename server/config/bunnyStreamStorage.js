// A multer storage engine that sends video/trailer parts straight on to
// Bunny as they arrive, instead of collecting the whole file in memory and
// only then starting the storage upload.
//
// Everything else about the request is unchanged: thumbnails still land in
// `file.buffer` exactly as `multer.memoryStorage()` produced them, so the
// routes' thumbnail handling does not move. A streamed part instead comes
// back carrying `bunnyFileName` and `bunnyUrl`, and the routes use those
// when present.
//
// Streaming needs the exact byte count up front (Bunny requires a
// Content-Length), so it only kicks in when the client declares the size in
// the query string — `?videoBytes=123&trailerBytes=456`. Without that the
// part is buffered exactly as before and the route uploads it the old way,
// which keeps any caller that has not been updated working untouched.
